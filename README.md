# Description

This RPG focused bot lets you roll any dice of your choice from a d20 to a d1000000 so that the sky is the limit. Advanced functionality includes the ability to roll many dice at the same time using 3d20 that rolls a d20 three times, or even many different dice like d20 + 3d4 + d100 all within the same command line. The program includes memory capability so that it remembers your last dice rolled and lets you add other dice to it. For example, if you roll a d10 and later needs to add a d20 just cap +d20 that it will sum the result to the last dice you rolled and so on.

This way, the RPG enthusiasts who use discord as their meeting place can roll their dices in public improving fairness in the game and enables those who do not yet have physical dice to use them easily and reliably.
